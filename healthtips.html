<h1>Women's Health Tips</h1>
<p>Besides laughing, certain foods have been proven to soothe stress and can counteract the damage that chronic pressure does to your bod. Stock up on these eats and beat down stress for good.</p>

<ul>
<h2><li>Don't Skip Breakfast</li></h2>
<p>Fiber in the morning means less hunger late in the afternoon, when you're most likely to feel tired and gorge yourself on sugar. My morning dose comes from steel-cut oatmeal, usually mixed with raisins, walnuts, and flaxseed oil. An early start on eating also keeps your metabolism more active throughout the day; breakfast eaters are thinner than people who just rush out the door.</p>

<h2><li>Hit the Sack</li></h2>
<p>Conan and Dave are funny, but they're not worth the strain on your system. Seven hours of sleep a night not only helps you live longer, but also lowers your stress, sharpens your memory, and reduces cravings for pants-splitting foods. Set a bedtime and stick to it. My target is 10:30 p.m. I record the late shows and then watch them the next day as I pedal a stationary bike.</p>

<h2><li>Admire Your Work</li></h2>
<p>Don't be so trigger-happy with the flusher. Turn around and take a look at your poop, which speaks volumes about your gut and overall health. Poop should be smooth and S-shaped, like your colon. If it comes out too lumpy, or drops into the bowl like marbles, you're constipated. Increase your fiber and water intake. This happens to me when I travel, so I fiber-load before a trip to avoid getting irritable.</p>

<h2><li>Don't Pamper Your Bad Back</li></h2>
<p>Even if you're hunched over in agony, taking to your bed will only make a bad back worse. The latest research shows that bed rest weakens back muscles and prolongs the suffering. Married men may suffer more than single men because of all the pampering. I used to love milking the care from Lisa, but the best solution is to get up, take a pain reliever, and be a soldier.</p>

<h2><li>Taste the Colors</li></h2>
<p>Foods with bright, rich colors are more than just nice to look at. They're also packed with flavonoids and carotenoids, powerful compounds that bind the damaging free radicals in your body, lowering inflammation. (Sadly, skittles do not count.) Eat nine fistfuls of colorful fruits and vegetables each day and you'll reap the benefits without having to give up other foods. Whenever I shop the produce aisle, I'm reminded that these foods are often more powerful than the drugs sold in pharmacies. My favorites are arugula and blueberries.</p>

<h2><li>Brushing is Not Enough</li></h2>
<p>If you plan to spend your later years eating more than yogurt and applesauce, invest in some floss. No matter how thoroughly or long you brush your teeth, you're missing a good portion of their total surface. That's like washing one armpit after a workout. But the dangers of skipping floss go beyond hygiene: The bacteria that linger can increase your risk of heart disease. I use Reach Ultraclean floss, which stretches to glide between teeth.</p>

<h2><li>Take a Deep Belly Breath</li></h2>
<p>Do this anywhere, anytime. Push out your bellows and suck air through your nose until your lungs are full. They'll fill with nitric oxide, a chemical found in the back of your nose that opens up blood vessels. The dose of oxygen will make you feel happier and more alert. This is my secret technique for calming down before a show or a tough stitch in the OR.</p>

<h2><li>Join a Yoga Class</li></h2>
<p>Yoga is the most important exer cise of my daily routine. Being surrounded by beautiful women in spandex should be reason enough for you to join a class, but if you need more motivation, consider this: Yoga eases stress, lowers blood pressure, slows heart rates, and increases flexibility. And there's nothing mystical about it. Loosening your muscles will make them more adaptable, so you may be less likely to injure yourself playing sports. Sure, some of the poses may look ridiculous, but that's for a reason you'll learn quickly enough. Yoga can reach and work muscles that are ignored during routine sports and daily life. My favorite maneuver is the sun salutation.</p>

<h2><li>Don't Be an Island</li></h2>
<p>Ever wonder why women live longer than men do? One major reason: You form tight networks and actually talk about your problems. If you face life's stresses alone, you will make yourself older. Bankruptcy, for example, causes enough stress to wreak havoc on your body. With another person's love and support, that inner aging can be reduced. Don’t forget to reach out to your friends when you need them.</p>

<h2><li>Avoid Fad Diets</li></h2>
<p>The secret to weight loss is not to avoid carbs, fats, yellow foods, solid foods, or foods that start with the letter G. The real trick is to lower your daily intake by about 100 calories. You'll hardly notice, but it'll add up to a loss of about 10 pounds in a year. Calorie restriction has been shown to lengthen life (in rats and monkeys). I cut back once a year to reset my appetite and tastebuds. Healthy food tastes great afterward. Frankly, any food would.</p>

<h2><li>Be a Smart Patient</li></h2>
<p>Your doctor can help keep you in good health, but the responsibility ultimately falls on you. Seek a second opinion before undergoing any procedure, because 30 percent of the time, that opinion will change the diagnosis or plan. Keep a written medical history, and educate yourself about any family problems, even if that means calling your creepy uncle. You might even consider signing onto Microsoft HealthVault or Google Health, so your files are accessible in case you find yourself in trouble away from home.</p>

<h2><li>Lose the Belly</li></h2>
<p>Grab a tape measure and put it around your body at the level of your belly button. That number should be less than half your height. So for my 6'1" frame, I need to keep my waist under 36.5". Just think—you’ll be avoiding heart attacks and diabetes as well as looking hot in your bikini. That’s a win win win.</p>

<h2><li>Go Green</li></h2>
<p>I drink green tea three times a day. It's packed with heart-boosting and cancer-stopping polyphenols that black tea doesn't offer. (These beneficial chemicals are lost when it's fermented.) Green tea also delivers a boost of alertness, but from a smaller dose of caffeine than black tea. Green tea can even fight dandruff, although only if you pour it directly onto your scalp. (It's probably a good idea to let it cool down first.)</p>

<h2><li>Sweat Till You're Wet</li></h2>
<p>If you can work up a sweat for just 1 hour a week, you'll enjoy a range of benefits: reduced risk of heart attack, better mood, and lower blood pressure. I like interval training on the elliptical, with 15 pullups and 15 dips every 10 minutes. Your muscles will become more efficient, so you'll have more stamina for more enjoyable activities that also work up a sweat.</p>

<h2><li>Put It in the Bank</li></h2>
<p>Most people rank personal finance as their number one stressor, usually because they feel powerless. Stress not only shortens lives, it also drives people to habits like smoking, drinking, or bingeing on food. Keep some money in a special bank account, safe from your lust for a new television, and you'll establish an emotional comfort zone with major health benefits.</p>

<h2><li>Have as Much Sex as Possible</li></h2>
<p>If a 50-something woman could have sex 700 times a year, the exercise and stress reduction would make her look and feel years younger. I wouldn't recommend quitting your day job in order to hit that number—but what's the harm in trying? The next time you don’t feel particularly in the mood, remind yourself that not having sex is literally killing you. It works for me.</p>

<h2><li>Know Your Numbers, Then Aim Lower</li></h2>
<p>Take the part of your brain dedicated to your nail salon’s phone number and reassign it to your heart's vital signs. These include blood pressure (which ideally should be below 115 over 75), LDL cholesterol (under 100), resting heart rate (under 70), and fasting blood sugar (under 100). If your numbers aren't ideal, change your diet until they improve.</p>

<h2><li>Add Some Weights</li></h2>
<p>Just 30 minutes twice a week spent lifting weights can build significant muscle mass. What's more, working all that muscle burns tons of calories, making it a great way to lose your gut, too. Don't have weights? Try lifting yourself: Pullups are the most valuable muscle-building exercises I do. Oprah's trainer, Bob Greene, pointed out to me that pullups work the back, pecs, arms, and belly all at once. And since you're lifting yourself, you'll think twice before eating that doughnut, because you'll just have to lift it later.</p>

<h2><li>Grab Some Nuts</li></h2>
<p>Nuts are among the best sources of healthful fats and protein around. I keep a bag of walnuts in my fridge and use their massive dose of omega-3 fatty acids to boost my brainpower while I see patients. Half of a handful eaten about 30 minutes before a meal will temper your appetite and help you avoid the drive-thru.</p>

<h2><li>Hit the Dance Floor</li></h2>
<p>Crosswords and card games aren't the only way to keep your brain razor sharp. It turns out that any kind of dancing with complex moves is stimulating enough to give your neurons a workout. Even the simplest moves provide some physical exercise. So don't be such a wallflower on your next night out.</p>
